"""
AIDEN V2 Tools Package

This package contains custom tools for the AIDEN agent.
Each tool should be defined in its own file and inherit from agno.tools.base.Tool.
"""

# Import all tools here for easy access
# Example: from .file_system_tool import FileSystemTool
# __all__ = ["FileSystemTool", "ShellTool", "CodeExecutionTool", ...]

# For now, this file just serves as a marker for the package.
# Tools will be dynamically loaded by the tool_loader.py module.
